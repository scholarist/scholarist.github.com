The late Steve Jobs is useful to the 1 percent insofar as he was a bold
innovator, creating value and remaking the future. His aura rubs off on
the finance bankers by association, making them seem like bold
leaders who enable folks like Jobs to do what they do. There's a big
difference between AIG and Apple, though, and as long as you can see
that, you can't understand what's going on. Confusion between the two
corporations provides cover to the people defending a rigged system. As
Krugman says, 

> They're not John Galt, they're not even Steve Jobs. They're people who

> delivering clear benefit to the American people, help push us into a
> crisis whose after effect continue to blight the lives of tens of
> millions of their fellow citizens.
