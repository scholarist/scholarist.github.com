title: "Google's Chrome OS is a Commitment Mechanism"
---

Since June when Google announced it would be [turning its Chrome web-browser into an operating system][1]
a lot of people have written about it. Google has now [released the Chrome OS source code][2] and netbook makers
have already [committed to shipping devices][4] running the operating system next year. For a quick refresher on
what the Chrome OS actually is see this [FAQ][3] or just watch this video:

<object width="480" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0QRO3gKj3qw&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0QRO3gKj3qw&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object>

I have wanted an operating system like this for a long time (read two years). But many people think the
Chrome OS is [too limited][5], [too old-fashioned][6] or just plain [stupid][7]. I won't respond directly
to those criticisms, but I will explain why I think Chrome OS is definitely the most promising software
development of 2009.

In economics and game theory there is this concept of a "commitment mechanism" -- something you choose to
do now that might not be in your best interest in the short-term, but will restrict your future choices in
a way that you know is optimal. For instance I choose all the time to avoid credit-cards with points-based
rewards programs, because I know that if I have one I will waste way too much time trying to figure out how
to maximize the value of my "rewards." It's just not worth it in the end, so I choose to avoid those offers.

Chrome OS is a commitment mechanism. By using it you commit yourself to using only hosted web-applications
like Gmail, and Salesforce, and ING Direct, and Zoho, and 37signals. You commit yourself to this because you know that
in the long run it is better for you. In a web-application only world you don't worry about what device
you're using to access your applications and data; any device with a web-browser will do. You don't worry
about your computer crashing; just get a new one with a web-browser and you're ready to go. You save money,
since you don't need any expensive hardware in your computer. And you're more efficient, since your computer
won't need as much power and you're not letting it sit unused all the time.

No you can't run Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop on Chrome OS _right now_. You can't run Mathematica or
play Grand Theft Auto on Chrome OS _right now_. That's the short-term cost of your commitment. But don't
be too short sighted; Hosted web-applications are here to stay. And I have no doubt that we will see "cloud"
versions of those applications within five years. In fact [Microsoft Office will be in the cloud][8] next
year. That's the great thing about this commitment. By choosing this path you actually force application
developers to move faster towards creating hosted and distributed "cloud" applications. And then everybody
wins. Give credit to Google for pushing this vision forward, and providing the commitment mechanism we need.
