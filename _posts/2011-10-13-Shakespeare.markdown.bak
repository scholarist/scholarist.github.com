Robert Atwan edits the _Best American Essays 2010_ and his introduction
makes a very good point about reading Shakespeare. You read him slowly,
making connections betwen bits of language, imagery, tropes, etc. These
things are everywhere, literally on every page, and a diagram of any
play is not so much a "Freytag Pyramid" of rising and falling action,
but a network of passages connected to one anotgher. Appreciating this
means reading slowly, going back over passages and rereading. An author
like Shakespeare rewards "slow reading" because everything is there,
waiting to be found. It seems that reading Shakespeare is a life
activity.

Nabokov talked aobut "major" and "minor" readers: "A good reader, a
major reader, an active reader is a rereader". 

Slow, patient, close reading, always with a pen in your hand.
