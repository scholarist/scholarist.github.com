<p>Writing software makes you hate bad software since you generally have ideas about how it could have been done better. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you think your software is good though. It just means you end up hating your own software as well.</p>
<p>The problem is that writing software is hard. And once you have something working you will do a lot of mental gymnastics to convince yourself that it doesn&#8217;t need to change. It&#8217;s kind of like building a highway through a city. A ton of time was spent building streets and parks and office-buildings and other infrastructure, and it all works pretty well. But now you want people to be able to get around <strong>faster</strong> using a highway. So now you have to somehow decide the best way to do that without completely disrupting the already functioning city below. A bunch of stuff is going to get destroyed, and in the process a lot of things won&#8217;t work for a little while, and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money.</p>
<p>So you sometimes end up with situations like in Washington, DC, where they started to connect I95 through downtown but only got halfway through. And in software a lot of times you end up with these kind of workaround solutions, created so that you don&#8217;t have to completely destroy what you started with. And you know you could have done it better. And you hate your software because you know what it could have been.</p>
