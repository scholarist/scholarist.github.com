<p>HDT talks about the trees in the neighborhood, listing them by name, and ending by calling them &#8220;shrines&#8221;. The chapter changes tack during a rainstorm, when he finds cover in what he at first thinks is an abandoned hut. He meets the Field family, poor Irish, supported by father John&#8217;s work as a bogger, who earns 10 dollars an acre for digging up meadowland.</p>

<p>Thoreau thinks he&#8217;s getting the short end of the deal as this work will cost him much more than 10 bucks a month.</p>

<p>I think some of the costs may be real&#8211;bogging is hard work and wears out heavy boots and clothing. Other costs, certainly, are the neglected opportunities Field and his family will miss by trying to pursue wealth the old -fashioned way, through hard and meaningless work that limits freedom. He notes Mrs. Field, saying she still thinks she can improve her life.</p>

<p>I detect a condescension to the poor Irish here and I probably reacted to it when I last read <em>Walden</em> about 10 years ago. HDT was blaming the poor for their problems. Of course I had no problem when HDT blames the bourgeoisie for <em>their</em> problems, because somehow I see the poor as different, with fewer resources to help themselves. This is equally condescending, of course, treating the poor as helpless.</p>

<p>Regardless of the cause of the poverty, the proper interpretation seems to be that anyone has agency, that anyone can do things to improve their life and escape poverty. Not by making more money, of course, but by living simply. When you redefine poverty as the lack of things that are really important in life, you can escape it this way.</p>

<p>Of course, this kind of secular renunciation is quietist. That&#8217;s another argument.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thoreau&#8217;s quietism is problematic. While he talks about a renunciation of worldly economic activity to all for more important pursuits, he leaves open what those pursuits should be. Having more time for your thoughts may mean having more time for writing and publishing anti-slavery lectures. Like John Brown, HDT was an ascetic in pursuit of something and not having to worry about spending all your time tending your farm freed him up to write things like &#8220;A Plea for Captain John Brown&#8221;.</p>

<p>Notice from August 30 1856:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you would really take a position outside the street and daily life of men, you must have deliberately planned your course, you must have business which is not your neighbors&#8217; business, which they cannot understand. For only absorbing employment prevails, succeed, takes up space, occupies territory, determines the future of individuals and states, drives Kansas out of your head and actually and permanently occupies the only desirable and free Kansas against all border ruffians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I ran into this notice directly after wondering about HDT&#8217;s &#8220;quietism&#8221;. John Field and his family, once they figured out how to live free, could plan a deliberately course of business outside of the ken of their neighbors. It would probably not be abolition, if I understand the 19th century Irish immigrant, but something else as important.</p>
<hr />
<p>HDT&#8217;s August 30 notice continues with the cranberry harvest. He gathers cranberries from a bog. Sometime before he told the owner about the berries and the farmer, not seeing a profit to be made, gave it up to HDT and his annual expeditions. An excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am the only person in the township who regards them or knows of them, and I do not regard them in the light of their pecuniary value. I have no doubt I felt richer wading there with my two pockets full, treading on wonders at every step, than any farmer going to marked with a hundred bushels which he has raked or hired to be raked. I got further and further from the town every moment, and my good genius seemed to have smiled on me leading me hither, and then the suddenly came out clear and bright, but it did not warm my feet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here he&#8217;s found his &#8220;absorbing employment&#8221;, far from the street and daily life of men.</p>
