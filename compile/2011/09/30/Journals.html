<p>September 30 2011</p>

<p>It seems that the heart of American literature, or at least all that&#8217;s good in American literature, is in Thoreau&#8217;s <em>Journals</em>. Thoreau wrote these to a high standard, and the sentences and paragraphs in his journal as as good as anything in <em>Walden</em>. There is no doubt about the quality of the <em>Journals</em> or of the labor that went into them.</p>

<p>What the <em>Journals</em> give up is Thoreau&#8217;s ongoing self-invention. Through the daily entries, Thoreau documents his development as a writer and a thinker. Since he had few models, and had testy relations with those, at best, he made up much of it as he went along. It was a hard road, and it took him years to shake off the nonsense he learned at Harvard (at least until 1850 or thereabouts).</p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing more American than this, or at least nothing more positively American. Canby says that in the 1830s a man could do anything he wanted except make a living as a artist or writer. Thoreau figured out a way to do just that, and documented the steps he took, one day at a time, for 25 years.</p>

<p>The <em>Journals</em> are a detailed exploration of a mind, and in this sense have the same aspirations as Montaigne&#8217;s <em>Essais</em>. They aren&#8217;t constructed as the <em>Essais</em> are, though, in that Thoreau doesn&#8217;t build them up into bigger pieces, revising and fitting them together (except when he draws extracts for a piece meant for publication, like <em>Walden</em> or <em>Walking</em>). Instead, the <em>Journals</em> are writing-in-process, daily writing, much like Pepys&#8217; famous diary, though without the nitty-gritty of daily life. Like Pepys, Thoreau couldn&#8217;t help but write everyday.</p>

<p>If I had to say what Thoreau&#8217;s great accomplishment was, it would be creating a new form combining the <em>Essais</em> and the <em>Diary</em>. And what a form it is.</p>
